# Testing System for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
This project aimed to test rpm, force, torque, watt, and voltage of the propellers.

In this project, I have used C language with Arduino IDE to maintain sustainable sensor values and optimize the calculated results. This project has been awarded by the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at ITU as Best Senior Design Project. I have developed software for the testing system in `main.ino`

## Requirements

You will need:

- Arduino Uno
- HX711 Load Cell Amplifier Board (2x) pins (5,6) and (3,4)
- LCD5110
- CNY70 or TCRT5000 (pin 0)
