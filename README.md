# Testing System for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
This project aimed to test rpm, force, torque, watt, and voltage of the propellers at the same time and print the results in graphs. In this project, I have used C language with Arduino IDE to maintain sustainable sensor values and optimize the calculated results. This project has been awarded by the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at ITU as Best Senior Design Project. I have developed software for the testing system.
